# MemeMe
This is the project that students are asked to complete in [UIKit Fundamentals (Udacity)] (https://www.udacity.com/course/uikit-fundamentals--ud788). 
A description of the project requirements can be found [here] (https://github.com/udacity/Project-Descriptions-for-Review/blob/master/iOS/MemeMe%202.0%20The%20Final%20Product.md). 

The app has some layout issues and the way I have implemented the requirements is not the same as what is shown in the course. Tackling these problems is a low priority at this stage.
